### 常见问答

1. __如何应用关联数据能力指标？__  在LD4PE项目中，指标有两个主要的用途。它提供了关联数据领域的一个概览，老师和学习者可以使用此概览来设计大学课程，培训工作组或者自己制定学习计划。 它还提供了一组在元数据中使用的URI，根据主题或涵盖的能力来[标准培训资料](http://explore.dublincore.net/explore-learning-resources-by-competency/)。

2. __为什么这些能力不进行编号以便容易参考？__  能力指标会随着时间不断地进化。原则上，主题，能力或者基准可以随时添加到指标中，这样可能会改变任一顺序编号系统的序号。因此，我们可能偶尔会发行较为稳定的版本。在这种情况下, 需要修改[用来创建Markdown文档的Python脚本](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/tree/master/docs/D2695955_to_md.py) 以 x (集群), x.x (主题), x.x.x (能力), x.x.x.x (基准)的形式计算条目的数量.  有编号的版本对指标的翻译者也会有帮助 (参见[中文翻译](http://explore.dublincore.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/LD4PECompetencyIndex-chinese.pdf)。如果你对此问题非常感兴趣，请在Github问题追踪系统中[发起一个问题](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/issues)。

3. __Are the URIs for competencies covered by the DCMI Namespace Policy?__ The [DCMI Namespace Policy](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-namespace/) lists several namespaces for which the organization makes a long-term commitment to their persistence and semantic stability.  Currently, all of those namespaces are managed under the [purl.org](http://purl.org) resolver service, where DCMI administers its own PURL subdomain.  From the start of the LD4PE Project, the URIs for topics and competencies in the Linked Data Competency Index have been coined and managed under the [Achievement Standards Network](http://asn.desire2learn.com).  The topic "Identity in RDF", for example, is identified with the URI [http://asn.desire2learn.com/resources/S2696001](http://asn.desire2learn.com/resources/S2696001).  In order to extend its namespace policy to cover such URIs, DCMI would need to better understand ASN's policies with regard to persistence or, possibly, consider coining dublincore.org or PURL URIs under its own control.  More fundamentally, we should ask ourselves how important is it that the things in the index have persistent identity and stable semantics?  The answer should depend to an extent on how the competency index is used in practice.  We might start by distinguishing between topics (and topic clusters), which change infrequently and can be used in metadata as broad subject headings, and competencies (and benchmarks), which will be coined and superseded more quickly as technology evolves.  In the LD4PE Project, competency URIs were used to [tag tutorial resources for retrieval by competency](http://explore.dublincore.net/explore-learning-resources-by-competency/).  Many of these materials, such as blog postings, will become superseded or unavailable.  Do the competencies used as their tags really need to be more persistent than the described resources themselves?
