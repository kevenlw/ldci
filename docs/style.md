### 撰写有效的“能力”和“基准”

| 能力 (理解) | 基准 (实施) |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| 理解         | 使用            |
| 了解         | 表达       |
| 识别          | 演示    |
| 区别 ...  | 转化 ...    |

1. 每个能力或基准都以一个行为动词开始。能力以与理想相关的动词开始。基准以关于实施的动词开始。

1. Limit each competency or benchmark to one sentence of circa 140 characters, the length of a Twitter posting.  If a thought seems to require more words, consider splitting it into two simpler thoughts.

1. Include historical context if possible.  Linked Data technology has largely evolved over the past quarter century and continues to evolve.  Knowing the year when a technology or concept was introduced helps readers, for example: _World Wide Web (1989)_, _HTTP (1991+)_, _URIs (1994)_, _OWL (2004)_, and _Linked Data (2006)_.

1. Include enough detail to characterize the nature of competency in a domain.  Competencies and benchmarks should not aim at covering all features of a technology, in the manner of a reference manual.  Attempts at comprehensiveness risk making the CI brittle in the face of inevitable change, and they risk making the CI boring to read.

1. Draw attention to ambiguity in the definition or use of terminology.  For example, one competency reads: _Knows that the word "ontology" is ambiguous, referring to any RDF vocabulary, but more typically a set of OWL classes and properties designed to support inferencing in a specific domain_.

1. Enlarge the set of topics covered by the index with prudence, bearing in mind that adding high-level topic cluster will broaden the scope of the index as a whole.  If new high-level topic clusters are proposed, however, consider whether they really fit into the scope of this particular competency index or, perhaps, imply the need for a second competency index with a different scope (for example, one focused on the design of Knowledge Organization Systems).
