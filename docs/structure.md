### 能力指标的结构

关联数据能力指标是描述课程标准、学习对象或学习结果的非常典型的比较宽泛的一类文档。没有一个标准方法来制订能力指标（有时被称为能力框架）。因为需要学习的科目的范围和学习的需求都非常的多样化，因此没办法进行规范化。根据指标的目的，能力指标编委会设计了以下结构：

__主题__.  主题是将一组能力分组的主题，例如_设计基于RDF的词汇表_ 和 _维护RDF词汇表_。  主题被分组在更高级别的主题集群中， 如 _RDF词汇表和应用纲要_.  

__Competencies__.  A competency is a brief phrase characterizing knowledge (facts, insights, habits of mind, or skills) that may be learned.  Competencies may be used as building blocks for constructing self-learning plans, university courses, or even entire curricula.  Under the topic _Querying RDF Data_, for example, one finds two competencies: 

> _Understands that a SPARQL query matches an RDF graph against a pattern of triples with fixed and variable values._

> _Understands the basic syntax of a SPARQL query._

__Benchmarks__.  A benchmark is a brief phrase describing an action that can demonstrate accomplishment in a given competency.  If competencies are about learning, benchmarks are about doing.  Benchmarks may be used for devising homework assignments, exam questions, or self-testing checklists.  Under the competency _Understands the basic syntax of a SPARQL query_, for example, one finds three benchmarks:

> _Uses angle brackets for delimiting URIs._

> _Uses question marks for indicating variables._

> _Uses PREFIX for base URIs._

By design, the index does not classify competencies or benchmarks by level of difficulty and makes no assumptions about the background knowledge or skill set of learners.  This is because concepts that are comparatively easy for a library science student may be hard for a computer science student, and vice versa.  The index should also not be taken to imply an inherent order to the topics.
